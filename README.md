# React Hooks To-do App

## Project

This was a project to learn to build and use context, reducers, and custom hooks in React.

A simple To-do App at first glance, but under the hood we're using custom hooks to manage state & context in React, as well as reducers to handle data and update localStorage on a users browser, so you can navigate away from the App or refresh and your To-Do's will persist.

Built using React, MaterialUI

Project based on a lesson by Colt Steele
